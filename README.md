# discord-bot

My own discord bot, which will have whatever features I decide to add to it

Currently it supports YouTube music in calls with video searching and queueing

# Installation

Ensure you have python3 interpreter installed, and FFmpeg

FFmpeg could be an environment path variable or the .exe in this directory on Windows, or installing if on Linux

Also, this required a .env file, with ```TOKEN=YOUR_API_KEY```

1. ``git clone LINK``
2. ``cd discord-bot``
3. ``pip install -r ./requirements.txt``
4. ``python bot.py``
